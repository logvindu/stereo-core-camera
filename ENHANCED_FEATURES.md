3. Press OK to proceed to positioning
```

### Phase 2: Camera Positioning & Configuration
```
1. Position cameras above core interval
2. View live preview for positioning
3. Adjust exposure with BRIGHTER/DARKER buttons
4. Fine-tune focus using FOCUS mode (optional)
5. Set depth range (From/To) with +/- adjustment
6. Press CAPTURE when ready
```

### Phase 3: Image Capture & Review
```
1. System captures stereo pair automatically
2. Review Camera 1 image quality ‚Üí OK/NO
3. Review Camera 2 image quality ‚Üí OK/NO
4. Images saved or discarded based on review
```

### Phase 4: File Management & Progression
```
1. Automatic save to internal storage
2. Automatic backup to USB drive (if available)
3. Files organized: ProjectName/BoreholeName/BoreholeName-From-To-C.jpg
4. Automatic progression to next segment:
   - From = previous To
   - To = From + 0.5m
5. Return to positioning for next interval
```
